# PDTK
Public Domain Toolkit is a lightweight (<25KB) event-driven framework using POSIX, C++14 code and OS specific event system backends for common UNIXes.

This framework allows for the use of signals and slots in a similar fashion to Qt but without the use of proprietary language extensions and zero license restrictions.
