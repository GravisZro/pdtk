# PUT
Public Unix Toolkit is a public domain lightweight (<20KB) event-driven toolkit using POSIX, C++14 code and OS specific event system backends for every UNIX, UNIX clone and UNIX variant.

This toolkit allows for the use of signals and slots in a similar fashion to Qt but without the use of proprietary language extensions and zero license restrictions.
